## Usage

To use The Perfect Holiday Shopping List, a user should first sign up for an account. Logging in will allow the user to view a dashboard page where they can access and edit their saved shopping list in addition to creating new ones. From the dashboard, each saved shopping list will be presented with options to either delete or view (edit). When creating or editing an shopping list, the user can view the whole list together. When done working with a shopping list, pressing the "Save" button will save the shopping lists to the database and return the user to the dashboard. For purposes of security, the page has been guarded against access without properly logging in, and only the user's own shopping list can be viewed.
